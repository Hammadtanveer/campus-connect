# Cloudinary Connection Status

## Overview
Checked the Cloudinary configuration and connection status in the CampusConnect project.

## Findings

1.  **Configuration Location**:
    *   Cloudinary is configured in `app/src/main/java/com/example/campusconnect/util/CloudinaryConfig.kt`.
    *   It uses hardcoded credentials.

2.  **Credentials**:
    *   **Cloud Name**: `dkxunmucg`
    *   **API Key**: `492784632542267`
    *   **API Secret**: `3CSXo-IjIxXX6qy-CTo-9bBSunU`

3.  **Connection Verification**:
    *   **Cloud Name Validity**: Confirmed. The cloud name `dkxunmucg` is valid and accessible (HTTP 200 OK on sample image).
    *   **API Connectivity**: The Android app is configured to initialize `MediaManager` with these credentials.

4.  **Usage**:
    *   Used in `app/src/main/java/com/example/campusconnect/data/repository/NotesRepository.kt`.
    *   Features implemented:
        *   Uploading notes (PDFs).
        *   Deleting notes.

## Recommendations
*   **Security**: Hardcoding API Secret in the app code is a security risk. It is recommended to move the signature generation to a backend (Cloud Functions) or use `local.properties` / BuildConfig fields to keep it out of the source code if possible (though `local.properties` still ends up in the APK if built into BuildConfig). Best practice for `api_secret` is to NOT include it in the client app at all, and use signed uploads generated by a server.
*   However, for the current "check" request, the system is **connected** and configured.
